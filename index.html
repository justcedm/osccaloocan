            <h4>
                Supreme Master Benedicto “Benny” P. Elopre, born on May 6, 1955, in Calabanga, Camarines Sur, 
                Philippines, began his martial arts journey inspired by his boxing hero 'Flash' Elorde. His 
                initial karate training was under Master Juanito Piaz during his elementary school years, 
                and he continued to train diligently through high school, ultimately embracing the Okinawan 
                Shorin-Ryu style. Over the years, he earned several black belt ranks and founded the Okinawa 
                Shorin-Ryu Clan to share his knowledge with both the clergy and the wider community. Known for 
                his visionary approach, Master Elopre combined karate's principles with his spiritual beliefs, 
                focusing on holistic development. Now an 8th Dan Okinawan Red & White Belt, he has established 
                many karate chapters across the Philippines and internationally, leaving a lasting impact on countless 
                students.
